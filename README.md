## Introduction

### The Project

FlexiGuardian is an innovative platform that aims to bridge the trust gap between service providers and clients by offering a secure and flexible medium for clients to rate and provide feedback on the service providers and/or vendors.
FlexiGuardian came to life, a project inspired by a personal journe
y and a desire to make a safe hub for vendors, service providers and customers, a just and secure place for everyone to rate, give feedback as reviews on business profiles as well as track contracts. It was inspired by the need to red
uce fraudulent activities as well as ensure quality for customers and business promotion.

### The Context
This project is my Portfolio Project, concluding my Foundations track at ALX software Engineering program powered by Holberton School. I came up with what I wanted to work on, as long as I present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.
